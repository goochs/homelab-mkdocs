# Community Info

The Homelab community is a group of individuals who build and maintain their own personal computer networks and server infrastructure at home.

We experiment with hardware, software, and various configurations to learn new skills and stay up to date with the latest technology.

The community loves to share knowledge, engage in online discussions, and often utilise our setups for practical purposes such as hosting websites, media servers, our own "cloud" storage, and more.

The community fosters collaboration and networking through open-source projects and occasionally meetups and online events, making it a valuable resource for those seeking hands-on experience and skill development in the IT industry.
