## How to Contribute

- All changes to this website are managed through GitHub pull requests, so you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) to contribute.
- You can suggest an edit directly via the `Edit this Page` button at the bottom of each page.
- To create a new page, you can use the [GitHub browser interface](https://github.com/HomelabCommunity/guides); the content is in  `docs`.
  - Please read about [the navbar and sidebars](#navbar-and-sidebars) before creating a new page.
- If you want to clone the repository and work locally, you may want to check out the [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation).  
You can use `npm start` to run a local development build. This is especially useful when you're working with changes that involve links or sidebars.

### Navbar and Sidebars

- The navbar is defined in `docusaurus.config.js`. Any changes require manual configuration.
  - [How to edit the navbar](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/themes/configuration#navbar)
